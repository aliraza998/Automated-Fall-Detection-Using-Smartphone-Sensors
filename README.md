# Automated-Fall-Detection-Using-Smartphone-Sensors

# Aims & Objectives
The main focus of the project is to develop automated systems that can accurately identify and classify 
elder human activity based on sensor data for enhancing the understanding of elderly human behavior and 
providing valuable contributions for various applications in healthcare. 

# Objectives
1. Research analysis on human activities, multiple sensors being used for activity recognition.
2. Identification and discussion about the appropriate strategy for an automatic fall detection system.
3. Analysis of smartphone sensors and smartwatches being utilized for human activity detection.
4. Collection and processing of suitable datasets.
5. Selection and training of machine learning/deep learning models for classification of elders' fall 
detection and other activities.
6. Application of different cross-validation on the dataset.
7. Training Performance analysis of models based on train/validation loss.
